    <title>CyberSec History</title>
    
    <h2>Introduction:</h2>
        <p>
            The field of cybersecurity holds a prominent position within the realm of information technology. The term “cybersecurity” encompasses a range of tools, methods, strategies, and practices that are employed to safeguard the security of computing systems, information, and other related systems, as well as their users.
Various courses on Cyber Security are offered due to its widespread appeal and significant relevance. However, a topic that is often overlooked or given limited attention is the historical context and background of cyber security. In this discussion, we will delve into the History of Cyber Security extensively.
        </p>

    <h2>Beginning of Cyber Security</h2>
        <p>
            The advent of computer connectivity to the internet and the subsequent exchange of messages has resulted in significant transformations in the realm of cybercrime. Despite the current significantly elevated level of risk compared to the past, computer users have harbored understandable apprehensions over these vulnerabilities for an extended duration.
The landscape of cyber hazards may undergo transformations in response to advancements in technology. Cybercriminals perpetually engage in the creation of novel methodologies to gain unauthorized access to computer systems and pilfer valuable data.
        </p>
    
    <h2>The 1970s: ARPANET and the Creeper</h2>
        <p>
            The inception and necessity of cybersecurity were observed throughout the 1970s. The decade in question played a significant role in the development and progression of the field of cyber security. The Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET) constituted the earliest undertaking in this field. Prior to the advent of the internet, the construction of this network of connectivity took place.
I assume the role of the elusive individual; endeavor to apprehend me if you possess the capability. The printed material was produced with a software application created by Bob Thomas, a developer associated with ARPANET, through the utilization of personal computers that were interconnected within the network. This program autonomously transitioned from one machine to another for the first time. While the experiment posed no threat, it can be inferred that this event marked the inaugural instance of a computer worm documented within the realm of cyber security.
The first objective of the emerging field of cybersecurity is to effectively eliminate any illicit software application. Ray Tomlinson, a researcher involved in the development of ARPANET, devised a networked mail messaging system and then developed a program named Reaper. This program effectively utilized all available resources to detect and eradicate the Creeper worm.

    <h2>The 1980s: The Birth of Commercial Antivirus</h2>
        <p>
            The occurrence of high-profile attacks witnessed a surge in regularity during the 1980s, exemplified by notable incidents at National CSS, AT&T, and Los Alamos National Laboratory. The 1983 film "War Games" depicts a scenario where a malevolent computer program assumes the guise of a game and assumes control over nuclear missile systems.
The names "Trojan Horse" and "computer virus" were introduced to the lexicon concurrently in the same year. During the duration of the Cold War, there was a notable escalation in the risk posed by cyber espionage. The current decade marks the significant emergence and proliferation of cybercrime within the annals of history.
The field of cybersecurity originated in 1987. While there are claims from multiple individuals regarding the creation of the initial antivirus program before that time, it was in 1987 that the commercial antivirus software era commenced with the introduction of Anti4us and Flushot Plus.

    <h2>The 1990s: The World Goes Online</h2>
        <p>
            The decade witnessed substantial expansion and development of the internet on a massive scale. Furthermore, the cybersecurity industry experienced significant growth. In the annals of computer security, the current decade has witnessed some noteworthy advancements:
                <ul>
                    <li>Concerns pertaining to polymorphic viruses have emerged. The first code that undergoes mutation as it propagates between computing systems while concurrently preserving the original algorithm was developed in the year 1990. The detection of the polymorphic virus was a significant challenge.</li>
                    <li>The DiskKiller malware was reportedly disseminated via PC Today, a periodical catering to computer enthusiasts. A significant number of computers were infected. The DVD was disseminated among individuals who subscribed to the magazine. The individuals asserted their lack of awareness regarding the potential risk and attributed the incident to an unintentional occurrence.</li>
                    <li>In order to circumvent the security restrictions imposed by antivirus software, fraudsters have devised novel methodologies. This period marked a significant juncture in the progression of cyber threats. Over the course of time, novel approaches for addressing the intensifying issues were devised. One of the technologies included in the aforementioned group was the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). The development of this strategy was aimed at enhancing the security of individuals while utilizing the internet. The Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol was first introduced in the year 1995. The utilization of this technology aids in enhancing the security of internet transactions, web surfing activities, and the protection of online data. The protocol was developed by Netscape. Subsequently, it would serve as the foundation for the contemporary HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) that is presently employed.</li>
                </ul>
