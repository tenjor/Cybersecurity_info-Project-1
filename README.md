# Cybersecurity Informational Brochure Website

##### Goal: My goal was to create an informational website about the Cybersecurity industry and how to get into this field using research. I want my website to target an audience that are curious about the industry and are willing to obtain more knowledge about Cybersecurity. The website will detail the history and future of the field. A form will also be included that will ask various questions to see if Cybersecurity would be the right career for you

# Index

##### For my index section, I wanted to create a very simple UI design that didn't overwhelm the user with a lot of information at once. Since Cybersecurity is a very broad topic that involves knowing a lot of things at a proficient level, it was important to design the website in such a way that made the user be curious and want to click on various elements if they would like to know more information

# History

##### The history section, by far, has the most information to read and digest on the website and will require the most research on my part. I feel that for the website to be cohesive, I needed to add a big informational piece about Cybersecurity and why it is important in the modern world which will, in turn, lead to my FORM.html inquiry. To attain this knowledge and information of the cybersecurity industry I used a book called "Cybersecurity: Current Writings on Threats and Protection" written by Joaquin Jay Gonzalez and Roger Kemp

# Form

##### The form I include in the website will ask various questions that should leave the user asking themselves "Is this field really for me or not?". The questions I managed to come up with are listed as follows

## Questionnaire

1. Are you passionate about technology?
2. Are you willing to continuously learn throughout your career?
3. Do you have a degree in Computer Science?
4. Do you know any coding languages, if so, are these languages used often in the cybersecurity field?
5. Are you comfortable with large amounts of responsibility?
6. Are you comfortable working in a team setting?
7. Do you feel that you have strong problem-solving skills?

## Questionnaire drop down informational

##### With each question, I felt that I should give a short explanation on why that specific question was asked, so I incorporated a clickable (see why this question was asked) link. The purpose of this is to keep the user engaged and so the user doesn't feel like they are filling out a survey for no reason

# CSS

For each HTML file, I made an individual CSS file. A personal CSS file for each corresponding HTML file will help keep things organized.
